I have two MSc, one in Game Dev with a focus on AI and the other in psychology with a focus on cyberpsychology and gaming. I have recently finished studying data science and machine learning with AiCore.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on 
  - **AirBnB Project:** An AiCore data science specilization project using neural networks to predict rental prices

    https://github.com/Millie-Jackson/AirBnB
    
  - **Car Price Prediction Project:** A deep learning educational project

    https://github.com/Millie-Jackson/Learning-Materials/tree/main/DEEP%20LEARNING
  
  - **Productivity Assistent Project:** A hobby project that combines multiple productivity techniques
  
    https://github.com/Millie-Jackson/Random-Projects/tree/main/Productivity%20Assistant

  - **Kitchen Assistent Project:** A hobby project which act as an interactive recipe book. It can pick out recipes based on what is in the pantry, seasonality of ingredients, preference and equipment. It also creates a combined task list for meal planning involving more than one recipe. This project will eventually be merged with a previous project (Data Collection Pipeline).

  - **LinkedIn:** www.linkedin.com/in/millie-jackson7
  - **Email:** millie.jackson1@gmail.com
 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my previous projects!
  - **Computer Vision Project:** Maybe my favorite project so far. I used TeachableMachine to play rock, paper, scissor with my webcab! This was a super fun project and I hope to add other webcam based mini games involving drawing 'in the air' to create a bundle of single and two player party games.

    https://github.com/Millie-Jackson/AiCore/tree/main/RPSProject
    
  - **Data Collection Pipeline:** An educational project with AiCore involving web scraping from my favorite recipe website (Pick up Limes) using Selenium and Chrome. Data is then uploaded to a cloud using AWS, containerised with Docker and CI/CD with Git Actions. This project is in desprate need of refactoring but I'm still willing to show it. This project will eventually be integrated into the kitchen assistant project to create the 'recipe book' along with web scraping from my other two favorite recipe sites (Avent Guard Vegan and Rainbow Plant Life) at which point I will refactor heavily.
